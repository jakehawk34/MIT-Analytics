# Unit 5: Text Analytics
# Predictive Coding: Bringing Text Analytics to the Courtroom (Recitation)

# We'll start with the story of Enron, the United States energy company based out of Houston, Texas that was involved
# in a number of electricity production and distribution markets.

# In the early 2000s, Enron was a hot company, with a market capitalization exceeding $60 billion,
# and Forbes magazine ranked it as the most innovative US company six years in a row.
# Now, all that changed in 2001 with the news of widespread accounting fraud at the firm.
# This massive fraud led to Enron's bankruptcy, the largest ever at the time, and led to Enron's accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, dissolving.

# FERC's investigation into Enron will be the topic of today's recitation.

# Now, Enron was a huge company, and its corporate servers contained millions of emails and other electronic files.
# Sifting through these documents to find the ones relevant to an investigation is no simple task.
# In law, this electronic document retrieval process is called the eDiscovery problem, and relevant files are called responsive documents.

# Now, as part of its investigation, the FERC released hundreds of thousands of emails
# from top executives at Enron creating the largest publicly available set of emails today.
# We will use this data set called the Enron Corpus to perform predictive coding in this recitation.
# Our data set contains just two fields-- email, which is the text of the email in question,
# and responsive, which is whether the email relates to energy schedules or bids.
