# Heart Attacks

# A 2012 report from the American Heart Association estimates about 715,000 Americans have a heart attack every year.
# To put this number into perspective, this means that every 20 seconds, a person has a heart attack in the United States.
# It is also equivalent of September the 11th repeating itself every 24 hours, 365 days a year.

# The nature of heart attacks, however, makes it hard to predict, prevent, and even diagnose.
# Here are some statistics.
# 25% of heart attacks are silent.
# 47% of sudden cardiac deaths occur outside hospitals, suggesting that many patients do not act on early warning signs.
# Only 27% percent of respondents to a 2005 survey recognized the symptoms and called 911 for help.

# How can analytics help? The key to helping patients is to understand the clinical characteristics of patients
# in whom heart attacks was missed.
# We need to better understand the patterns in a patient's diagnostic history that link to heart attack
# and to predicting whether a patient is at risk for a heart attack.

# Quick Question 1

# Logistic Regression, CART, and Random Forest are all designed to be used to predict whether or not someone has a heart attack, 
# since this is a classification problem.
